Traditional Networking equipment runs proprietary software with proprietary hardware (Vendor-Locking)(Inside the box paradigm.We aim to {compare multiple controllers} in order to understand how they behave under different environments.

We try to select controllers based on network scenario so as to attain network's objective in the most efficient manner.A handful of controllers are deployed in different environments relate-able to type of networks that exist in reality and we test the performance of the controllers using a benchmark tool.

Other researches on SDN Controllers have published results showing comparison of raw performance against traffic volume.Traffic volume is defined as the product of the average traffic intensity and the time period of the study.

A traffic volume of one erlang-hour can be caused by two circuits being occupied continuously for half an hour or by a circuit being half occupied (0.5 erlang) for a period of two hours.

Our aim is to send a huge traffic to the Controller and records its performance metrics. Then, analyse the obtained values to figure out the system performance of the controller.
