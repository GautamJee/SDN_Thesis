Throughout the years, various Software Defined Network (SDN) working frameworks have been created in various dialects models. The level of significance in a SDN engineering is its control plane which is administered by the substance called ''Controller''. Thus there is a need to comprehend the benefits and bad marks of these controllers with the goal that one may pick a proper usage for a system situation. Here, an investigation of two SDN controllers is performed with the expect to comprehend the framework usage of SDN Controller under overwhelming traffic and gives a superior thought regarding its running nature, framework, bottlenecks, and so forth which could additionally tell the engineers the improvement territories to work in its up and coming renditions.
