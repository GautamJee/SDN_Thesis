Over the years, a number of Software Defined Network (SDN) operating systems have been developed in different languages architectures. The tier of importance in an SDN architecture is its control plane which is governed by the entity called ``Controller''. Hence there is a need to understand the merits and demerits of these controllers so that one may choose an appropriate implementation for a network scenario. Here, a study of two SDN controllers is performed with the aim to understand the system utilization of SDN Controller under heavy traffic and gives a better idea about its running nature, system, bottlenecks, etc. which could further let the developers know the improvement areas to work in its upcoming versions.
